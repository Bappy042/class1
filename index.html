                The Asian Cricket Council Asia Cup is a men's One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket tournament.
                It was established in 1983 when the Asian Cricket Council was founded as a measure to promote goodwill between Asian countries.
                It was originally scheduled to be held every two years. <u>The Asia Cup is the only continental championship in cricket and the winning team</u> becomes the champions of Asia.
                It alternates every 2-years between ODI and T20I formats.
                <strong> first Asia cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the council's offices were based (until 1995).</strong>
                India boycotted the 1986 tournament due to strained cricketing relations with Sri Lanka. 
                <i>Pakistan boycotted the 1990â€“91 tournament due to strained political relations with India </i>and the 1993 tournament was cancelled for the same reason. 
                The ACC announced that the tournament would be held biennially from 2009 onwards.[3] 
                The ICC has ruled that all games played in the Asia Cup have official ODI status.
